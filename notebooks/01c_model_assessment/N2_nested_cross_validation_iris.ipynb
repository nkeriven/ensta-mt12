    "Model selection without nested CV uses the same data to tune model parameters\n",

    "the size of the dataset and the stability of the model. See Cawley and Talbot\n",
    "[1] for an analysis of these issues.\n",

    "To avoid this problem, nested CV effectively uses a series of\n",

    "the outer loop (here in :func:`cross_val_score\n",

    "  1. Explain why the prediction performances estimated by non-nested CV \n",

    "## Solutions\n",
    "1. The risk is to get too specific hyperparameters that overfit the validation sets. In this case, the estimated test error fot these hyperparameters may be too optimistic.\n",
    "2. Nested cross validation makes use of an outer-loop to evaluate the performances on some validation sets called *test sets* (as they are only used to evaluate the test error, not to select a model), that differ from the ones used in the inner-loop. Thus the risk that the hyperparameters selected in the CV inner-loop also overfit these test sets is much reduced. This yields a more reliable estimate. We can check this here on the simulation results: the non nested CV is almost always slightly too optimistic because we tend to overfit the inner-loop validation sets when we select the best hyperparameters.\n",
    "3. Using a separate test set, which is not used fot training or hyperparameter selection, yields an unbiased estimate of the true error (the test error)\n",
    "4. Both methods give proper or accurate estimation of the test error. \n",
    "\n",
    " Advantages of the \"separate test set\" split approach:\n",
    " \n",
    "  - conceptually easier to understand\n",
    "  - nested cross validation is more computationnaly intensive as it requires an additional CV in the outer-loop.\n",
    " \n",
    " Main advantage of the \"nested CV\":\n",
    " \n",
    "  - Nested CV does not require to split the original dataset. All the available samples can be used in the two CV loops conversely to the \"separate test set\" approach. This makes possible to obtain more performant prediction rules with a proper estimation of the associated test error.\n",
